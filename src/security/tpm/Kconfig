config NO_TPM
	bool "No TPM"
	help
	  No TPM support. Select this option if your system doesn't have a TPM,
	  or if you don't want coreboot to communicate with your TPM in any way.
	  (If your board doesn't offer a TPM interface, this will be the only
	  possible option.)

	  Select this option if your TPM uses the older TPM 1.2 protocol.

config TPM2
	bool "TPM 2.0"
	depends on I2C_TPM || MEMORY_MAPPED_TPM || SPI_TPM || CRB_TPM

config MAINBOARD_HAS_TPM1
	bool
	help
	  This option can be selected by a mainboard to represent that its TPM
	  always uses the 1.2 protocol, and that it should be on by default.

config MAINBOARD_HAS_TPM2
	bool
	help
	  This option can be selected by a mainboard to represent that its TPM
	  always uses the 2.0 protocol, and that it should be on by default.

config TPM_DEACTIVATE
	bool "Deactivate TPM"
	default n
	depends on !VBOOT

	  Deactivate TPM by issuing deactivate command.

	  Allows the payload to handle activate/deactivate of TPM.

	  This option enables additional TPM related debug messages.

config TPM_RDRESP_NEED_DELAY
	bool "Enable Delay Workaround for TPM"
	default n
	depends on MEMORY_MAPPED_TPM
	help
	  Certain TPMs seem to need some delay when reading response
	  to work around a race-condition-related issue, possibly
	  caused by ill-programmed TPM firmware.

config TPM_STARTUP_IGNORE_POSTINIT
	bool
	help
	  Select this to ignore POSTINIT INVALID return codes on TPM
	  startup. This is useful on platforms where a previous stage
	  issued a TPM startup. Examples of use cases are Intel TXT
	  or VBOOT on the Intel Arrandale processor, which issues a
	  CPU-only reset during the romstage.

config TPM_MEASURED_BOOT

	  Custom coreboot-specific format of the log derived from TPM1 log format.
config TPM_LOG_TPM1

	  Initialize TPM inside the bootblock instead of ramstage. This is

	  measurement like Intel TXT/CBnT.

config TPM_SETUP_HIBERNATE_ON_ERR
	bool
	depends on EC_GOOGLE_CHROMEEC
	default y
	help
	  Select this to force a device to hibernate on the next AP shutdown when a TPM
	  setup error occurs. This will cause a cold boot of the system and offer an
	  opportunity to recover the TPM should it be hung. This is only effective if
	  the Z-State brings the power rail down.
