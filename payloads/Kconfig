	  Select this option if you want to create an "empty" coreboot
	  ROM image for a certain mainboard, i.e. a coreboot ROM image
	  which does not yet contain a payload.

	  For such an image to be useful, you have to use 'cbfstool'

	  You will be able to specify the location and file name of the
	  payload image later.
