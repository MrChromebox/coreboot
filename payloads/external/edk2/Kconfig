	help
	  Select this option if you want to build a coreboot image
	  with EDK2s Universal Payload. If you don't know what this is
	  about, just leave it enabled.

	  Universal Payload should ideally only be built from upstream EDK2,
	  https://github.com/tianocore/edk2, as this is regularly build tested
	  and it encourages patches to be merged upstream.

	  Whilst the required patches are being merged, this is pointed to
	  Star Labs GitHub repository which contains these patches and is based
	  on a known working commit.

	  See https://universalscalablefirmware.github.io/documentation/ for more information.

	  The path and filename of the file to use as graphical bootsplash
	  image. If this option is not configured, the default
	  coreboot logo (European Brown Hare) will used.

	  You can use any image format supported by imagemagick, a list of which
	  can be found [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php).

	  The build process will automatically convert this to the format that
	  edk2 requires, which is an uncompressed BMP, in BMP3 format. It does
	  this using imagemagick (`convert splosh.bmp BMP3:splash.bmp`).

	  The newly formatted file will be the dimensions size as the original
	  one.

	  The build process will automatically do this conversion, so it can
	  be supplied with any format that imagemagick can process (which is
	  pretty much any!).

	  This image will also be used as the BGRT boot image, which may
	  persist through your OS boot process.

	  See ACPI spec 6.3, 5.2.22 Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT), and
	  Microsoft's documentation on BGRT positioning:
	  Docs/Windows/Windows Drivers/Bring up guide/Boot screen components

	  Accordingly, the image used should be no taller/wider than 40% of
	  the display panel's native pixel height/width (or resolution set).

	  If an absolute path is not given, the path will assumed to be
	  relative to the coreboot root directory.

	  EDK2 must include a different library which is the reason why this must be
	  configured at build time.

	  If this is enabled, and the CPU doesn't support 0x15, it will fail to
	  boot. If it is not enabled, and the CPU does support 0x15, it will still
	  boot but without support for the leaf. Consequently, it is disabled by
